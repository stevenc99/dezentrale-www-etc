# This file is used by ikiwiki-mass-rebuild script to rebuild the listed
# wikis. Run this script when upgrading ikiwiki to an incompatible new
# version that requires rebuilding everything.
#
# ikiwiki-mass-rebuild su's to the listed user and then runs ikiwiki --setup
# on the specified ikiwiki setup file.
#
# It's also possible to let a user list setup files in ~user/.ikiwiki/wikilist
# in their home directory. To do so, list only the user's name, without a
# setup file. The format of ~/.ikiwiki/wikilist is the same as this file.
